# RAMP – Routing and API Management Platform
RAMP is a high-performance, open-source API gateway built with Rust, designed for modern microservices architectures. It provides secure, scalable, and efficient API routing and management capabilities.

## Features
- 🚀 **High Performance**: Built with Rust and Actix-web for maximum throughput
- 🔒 **Security**: JWT authentication, rate limiting, and request validation
- ⚙️ **Configurable**: YAML-based configuration for easy setup
- 📊 **Monitoring**: Built-in Prometheus metrics and Grafana integration
- 🔄 **Routing**: Smart routing with path-based and load-balanced strategies
- 📈 **Scalable**: Designed for horizontal scaling in cloud environments
- 🧩 **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for custom functionality

## Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.65+
- OpenSSL (for TLS support)

### Installation
1.	Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   Git clone https://github.com/yourorg/RAMP.git

   Cd RAMP

   ```
2.	Build the project:

   ```bash

   Cargo build –release

   ```
3.	Generate TLS certificates:

   ```bash

   ./scripts/generate_tls_certs.sh

   ```
4.	Configure the gateway by editing `config.yaml`
5.	Run the gateway:
   
   ```bash

   Cargo run –bin gateway-core -- --config config.yaml

   ```


## Configuration
Example `config.yaml`:

```yaml

Listen_address: “0.0.0.0:8080”

Jwt_secret: “your-secure-secret”

Default_rate_limit: 100

Routes:

-	Path: “/api/users”

    Target: http://user-service:8001

    Methods: [“GET”, “POST”]

    Auth_required: true

    Rate_limit: 50

```
See [Configuration Documentation](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for more details.
